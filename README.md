# Discrete Clj

A Clojure lib to demonstrate discrete math concepts in a readable way.

## Components

### Cardinality

How do we think about the cardinality of infinite sets?

### Combinatorics

Examples are shown in simple recusive solutions as well as leveraging Clojure's math.combinatorics library.

### Graphs

Much of computer science involves modeling data as a graph, and some of the most elegant algorithms traverse and analyze graphs in creative ways. Discrete-Clj uses the excellent Loom library to demonstrate usage rather than rolling our own.

### Peano numbers

Whole numbers can be represented as a repetition of symbols representing successors on a symbol representing zero.

### Relations

Demonstate how items can be modeled as relating to one another.

### Trees

Trees are some of the most fundamental data structures in computer science.

### Utilities

A general collection of helper functions to work with data structures in various ways.

## Dependencies

* Clojure math.combinatorics
* Clojure math.numeric-tower
